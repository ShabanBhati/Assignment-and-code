    <dt><b><u>Description Of the Book📕</u></b></dt><br>
    <dd>👉 Wings of Fire is a deeply inspiring autobiography of Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, a renowned Indian
        aerospace scientist who rose to become the 11th President of India. Co-authored with Arun Tiwari, the book
        offers a compelling insight into the life of a visionary who played a pivotal role in India's defense🪖 and space
        research programs 👩‍🚀🚀. <br><br>

    <dd> 👉 The narrative begins in the small temple🛕 town of Rameswaram, where Kalam was born into a modest family👨‍👩‍👧‍👦. Despite
        financial hardships, he was raised with strong values, spiritual discipline, and a thirst for knowledge. His
        early experiences, relationships with his parents and mentors, and exposure to religious🕋 harmony deeply shaped
        his personality.
    </dd><br>
    <dd> 👉 The Book📕 then traces Kalam's academic journey from Schwartz High School 🎒to the Madras Institute of Technology,
        showcasing his relentless pursuit of learning. His career took flight when he joined the Defence Research and
        Development Organisation (DRDO) and later the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), where he worked on
        pioneering projects such as the SLV-III satellite launch vehicle and was instrumental in the success of the Agni
        and Prithvi missile programs.</dd> <br>

    <dd>👉 What makes Wings of Fire🔥 remarkable is not just the chronicle of scientific achievements but the human story
        behind them — marked by perseverance, failures, teamwork, and unwavering faith. The book is filled with
        reflections on leadership, innovation, and the power of dreams. Kalam's humility, devotion to national service,
        and deep connection with India's youth resonate throughout the pages.</dd> <br>

    <dd>👉 More than just an autobiography🖊️, Wings of Fire is a guidebook for young minds. It motivates readers to rise
        above circumstances, believe in their abilities, and contribute meaningfully to society. The book continues to
        inspire millions across the world with its message of hope, courage, and determination.</dd>
